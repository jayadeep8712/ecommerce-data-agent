# \# E-commerce AI Data Agent

# 

# !\[E-commerce AI Agent Screenshot](./assets/agentui.png) 

# 

# This project is a sophisticated AI-powered agent designed to answer natural language questions about e-commerce data. It features a modern, interactive web interface where users can ask questions, view data, and see visualizations in real-time.

# 

# \## üåü Core Features

# 

# \-   \*\*Natural Language to SQL:\*\* Utilizes Google's Gemini LLM to understand user questions and convert them into precise SQL queries.

# \-   \*\*Interactive Data Visualization:\*\* Automatically generates interactive charts using Plotly for query results that are suitable for visualization.

# \-   \*\*Real-time Streaming:\*\* Employs FastAPI's `StreamingResponse` to provide a live, "thinking" effect as the agent processes a request.

# \-   \*\*Standalone Chart Downloads:\*\* Allows users to download visualizations as self-contained HTML files for reporting and sharing.

# \-   \*\*Modern UI/UX:\*\* A sleek, dark-themed, and responsive user interface inspired by leading AI chat applications.

# 

# \## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

# 

# \-   \*\*Backend:\*\* Python, FastAPI

# \-   \*\*Database:\*\* SQLite

# \-   \*\*AI / LLM:\*\* Google Gemini API (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`)

# \-   \*\*Data Handling:\*\* Pandas, SQLAlchemy

# \-   \*\*Visualization:\*\* Plotly

# 

# \## üöÄ Getting Started

# 

# Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

# 

# \### Prerequisites

# 

# \-   Python 3.10+

# \-   A Google Gemini API Key

# 

# \### Installation

# 

# 1\.  \*\*Clone the repository:\*\*

# &nbsp;   ```bash

# &nbsp;   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ecommerce-data-agent.git

# &nbsp;   cd ecommerce-data-agent

# &nbsp;   ```

# 

# 2\.  \*\*Create and activate a virtual environment:\*\*

# &nbsp;   \*   On Windows:

# &nbsp;       ```bash

# &nbsp;       python -m venv venv

# &nbsp;       .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate

# &nbsp;       ```

# &nbsp;   \*   On macOS/Linux:

# &nbsp;       ```bash

# &nbsp;       python3 -m venv venv

# &nbsp;       source venv/bin/activate

# &nbsp;       ```

# 

# 3\.  \*\*Install the required packages:\*\*

# &nbsp;   ```bash

# &nbsp;   pip install -r requirements.txt

# &nbsp;   ```

# 

# 4\.  \*\*Set up your environment variables:\*\*

# &nbsp;   \*   Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory.

# &nbsp;   \*   Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:

# &nbsp;       ```

# &nbsp;       GOOGLE\_API\_KEY="YOUR\_API\_KEY\_HERE"

# &nbsp;       ```

# 

# 5\.  \*\*Initialize the database:\*\*

# &nbsp;   \*   The project comes with three CSV datasets in the `/data` directory.

# &nbsp;   \*   Run the setup script to create and populate the SQLite database:

# &nbsp;       ```bash

# &nbsp;       cd scripts

# &nbsp;       python setup\_database.py

# &nbsp;       cd ..

# &nbsp;       ```

# &nbsp;   \*   This will create an `ecommerce\_data.db` file in the root directory.

# 

# \### Running the Application

# 

# 1\.  \*\*Start the FastAPI server with Uvicorn:\*\*

# &nbsp;   ```bash

# &nbsp;   uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# &nbsp;   ```

# 

# 2\.  \*\*Access the application:\*\*

# &nbsp;   \*   Open your web browser and go to \*\*`http://127.0.0.1:8000`\*\*.

# 

# \## üìù How It Works

# 

# The application follows a simple but powerful agentic loop:

# 

# 1\.  \*\*Perceive:\*\* The FastAPI backend receives a user's question from the web interface.

# 2\.  \*\*Think (Text-to-SQL):\*\* The question is sent to the Gemini LLM, which is prompted to convert it into an SQL query based on the database schema.

# 3\.  \*\*Act (Query):\*\* The generated SQL is executed against the local SQLite database.

# 4\.  \*\*Think (Visualization):\*\* The query results are analyzed. If suitable (i.e., multiple rows and numeric data), an interactive Plotly chart is generated.

# 5\.  \*\*Act (Respond):\*\* The final payload, containing the data answer, SQL query, and chart information, is streamed back to the user's browser for rendering.

# 

# \## üí° Example Questions

# 

# You can try asking the agent questions like:

# \-   "What is my total sales?"

# \-   "Calculate the RoAS"

# \-   "Which 5 products had the highest CPC?"

# \-   "Show me total ad sales by date"

# \-   "What are the top 5 products by ad spend?"
